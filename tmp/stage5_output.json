I've been writing code, reading code, and living vicariously through computers for as long as I can remember. I like to build things that work. I also dabble in machining, welding, cooking and skiing.<br/><br/>\n\n    I'm currently an engineer at Amazon Web Services (AWS) in Seattle, where I work on databases, serverless, and serverless databases. Before that, I worked on EC2 and EBS.<br/>\n\nAll opinions are my own.\n    <h1>Links</h1>\n    <a href=\"https://brooker.co.za/blog/publications.html\">My Publications and Videos</a><br/>\n    <a rel=\"me\" href=\"https://fediscience.org/@marcbrooker\">@marcbrooker on Mastodon</a>\n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarcJBrooker\">@MarcJBrooker on Twitter</a>\n  </div>\n\n  \n  <div id=\"post\">\n<h1 id=\"you-are-here\">You Are Here</h1>\n\n<p class=\"meta\">Where to next?</p>\n\n<p>The cost of turning written business logic into code has dropped to zero. Or, at best, near-zero.</p>\n\n<p>The cost of integrating services and libraries, the plumbing of the code world, has dropped to zero. Or, at best, near-zero.</p>\n\n<p>The cost of building efficient, reliable, secure, end-to-end systems is starting to drop, but slowly.</p>\n\n<p>Where does that leave those of us who have built careers in technology? Our road diverges. Not into the undergrowth of a wood, but into a dense fog. The future is harder to see than ever. But lets peer forward and see as best we can.</p>\n\n<p>On the first road we can see this as the end to a craft we have loved. The slow end of <em>programming</em> as an economic discipline, as weaving, ploughing, and coopering went before. It is reasonable and rational to feel a sense of loss, and a sense of uncertainty. With the loss of the craft comes the loss of the economic moment where that craft was valued beyond nearly any other. Perhaps any other in history. It is irrational to feel denial. You are here.</p>\n\n<p>On the second road we can see this moment as the beginning of something new. With new tools comes greater opportunity than ever. Greater economic opportunity for those who value that. Greater technical opportunity for those who value that. The most powerful set of new tools since the dawn of computing itself. With these tools come risk, and with risk comes opportunity. With these tools come new industries, new fields of research, and new careers. All bring opportunity.</p>\n\n<p><em>The First Road</em></p>\n\n<p>Back at university, I knew this guy. Mostly retired. An absolute wizz at circuit design and analog electronics. Like nobody I’ve encountered since. In the late 1960s, him and some buddies started a hardware company. They’d seen digital electronics coming, the 74 series had just launched. They didn’t like it. No class. No beauty. Unreliable and full of problems. So they started this company betting that serious customers wouldn’t accept the downsides of digital logic, and analog was the way of the future for real automation. Statistically, measured by the ratio of transistors in digital and analog circuits in the year 2026, it’s unlikely anybody has ever been more wrong. Wrong by ten or more orders of magnitude.</p>\n\n<p>He made a small fortune along this path. Not a large one, but enough to keep his children comfortable. The first road will surely have similar winners. The stubborn who stick to the old ways, and hustle to squeeze out the remaining economic value. That value will remain, because the world always changes slower than we would like.</p>\n\n<p>But those that succeed along this road will increasingly be those that acknowledge what they’re doing, and why they’re doing it. Picking up the parts of an old world, now gone, but intentionally.</p>\n\n<p>There will still be joy in programming. Just as there’s joy in joinery, knitting, and hiking. You’re not wrong to love programming. I love it too. You’re not wrong to feel a deep sense of loss. I feel it too.</p>\n\n<p><em>The Second Road</em></p>\n\n<p>What careers lie on the second road? Perhaps surprisingly, this seems harder to predict. My guess is that there are fortunes to be made exploiting the new technology, building faster, and out-competing a valuable incumbent. There are decades of great companies to build following that recipe. There are great careers in technology and science to be made applying this new technology to old problems, bringing new tools into tricky places, and solving the previously unsolvable. There are both fortunes and careers to be made in solving the problems this new technology introduces, allowing everybody else to exploit it to its maximum potential.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, my best prediction is that the next two decades look like the last four. Hardly a prediction worthy of an oracle.</p>\n\n<p>Today, it seems like the biggest opportunities will be in the third of my opening statements. Building systems remains hard. Can I assume you’re familiar with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law\">Amdahl’s Law</a>? That’s what’s going on: a massive speed up on a portion of the problem, but as that portion speeds up it becomes less and less of a contributor to the overall speedup. Lowering the costs of the rest of the problem is work that remains to be done. It’s going to take a long time, because the real world is fully of sticky problems, surprising feedback loops, human stubbornness, and the occasional adversary.</p>\n\n<p>There’s also going to be great value in ideas. Integration and translation are solved problems. Simple analysis, and small scale synthesis are too. But new ideas, real transformative new ideas, remain hard to come by. And, as the lever gets longer, more and more valuable.</p>\n\n<p>Software’s first act is over. The second act won’t go like anybody expects, but I can bet that it’ll be more interesting, more economically valuable, and more mentally stimulating than we can imagine right now.</p>\n\n<p>I can’t wait to be part of it.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n<div id=\"related\">\n  &laquo; <a href=\"/blog\">Back to the blog index</a><br>\n  <br>\n  <!-- Similar Posts -->\n  <h4>Similar Posts</h4>\n  <ul class=\"posts\">\n    \n      \n        <li><span>21 Jan 2026</span> &raquo; <a href=\"/blog/2026/01/21/pass-k.html\">Pass@k is Mostly Bunk</a></li>\n      \n        <li><span>12 Jan 2026</span> &raquo; <a href=\"/blog/2026/01/12/agent-box.html\">Agent Safety is a Box</a></li>\n      \n        <li><span>16 Dec 2025</span> &raquo; <a href=\"/blog/2025/12/16/natural-language.html\">On the success of 'natural language programming'</a></li>\n      \n    \n  </ul>\n  \n  <!-- Dissimilar Posts -->\n  \n</div>\n\n  \n  <div class=\"footer\">\n    <div class=\"contact\">\n      <p>\n        Marc Brooker<br />\n        The opinions on this site are my own.

I suspected NO. Fit an entire C compiler in 510 bytes of instruction memory? Good luck (sarcasm).</p>\n<h2>Tokenizing</h2>\n<p>The first problem came quickly. In C, the tokenizer/lexer alone seems larger than one 512 byte sector! We need to consume an arbitrary stream of bytes and produce “tokens”.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-c\">int main()\n{\n  if( a &lt; 5 ){\n    func();\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Would be consumed and converted into:</p>\n<pre><code>'int'  TOKEN_KEYWORD_INT\n'main' TOKEN_IDENTIFIER\n'('    TOKEN_LPAREN\n')'    TOKEN_RPAREN\n'{'    TOKEN_LBRACE\n'if'   TOKEN_KEYWORD_IF\n'('    TOKEN_LPAREN\n'a'    TOKEN_IDENTIFIER\n'&lt;'    TOKEN_OPERATOR\n'5'    TOKEN_NUMBER\n')'    TOKEN_RPAREN\n'{'    TOKEN_LBRACE\n'func' TOKEN_IDENTIFIER\n'('    TOKEN_LPAREN\n')'    TOKEN_RPAREN\n';'    TOKEN_SEMI\n'}'    TOKEN_RBRACE\n'}'    TOKEN_RBRACE\n</code></pre>\n<p>We need to specifically recognize <code>keywords</code>, <code>identifiers</code>, <code>operators</code>, and <code>numbers</code>. And then we need to convert numbers from string to integer with something like <code>atoi()</code>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-c\">int atoi(const char *s)\n{\n  int n = 0;\n  while (1) {\n    char c = *s++;\n    if (!c) break;\n    n = 10 * n + (c - '0');\n  }\n  return n;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I wrote a fairly straight-forward and minimalist lexer and it took &gt;150 lines of C code. A crude estimate of the same code in x86-16 would require 300-450 bytes minimum (e.g. a simple <code>add ax,bx</code> instruction encodes as 2 bytes). And this doesn’t include any symbol table, recursive-descent parser, code-generator, branch-patching, etc.</p>\n<p>No Chance.</p>\n<p>So, naturally … I continued. Always pick the losers. The lolz are more fun that way.</p>\n<h3>Big Insight #1</h3>\n<p>Big Insight #1 came while thinking about other languages such as Forth. The tokenizer in Forth is nearly trivial. Every token is simply space-delimited. Every token is just called a <code>WORD</code> and nothing is special (slight lie). Hmm, how about a C that does that? So dreamed up a C that is technically still a C, is probably turing-complete, and will definitely make every code maintainer terrified. 😏</p>\n<p>I will call it the <em>Barely C Programming Language</em>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">int done , a , b , c , p , cond ;\nint(main)(){while(!done){\n     a = b - c ;\n     *(int*) p = b - c ;\n     a = *(int*) p ;\n     if(cond) a = b - 45 ;\n}}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here we have spacing strategically placed to create “mega-tokens”</p>\n<p>For example: <code>int(main)(){while(!done){</code> is one such \"mega-token\".</p>\n<p>In a sense, we actually have a language more like:</p>\n<pre><code>VAR_BEGIN done AND a AND b AND c AND p AND cond END\nMAIN_BEGIN\n  a = b - c END\n  DEREF p = b - c END\n  a = DEREF p END\n  COND a = b - 45 END\nMAIN_END\n</code></pre>\n<p>But, a normal C compiler will also recognize it as C!</p>\n<p>Even after using space-delimiters, we still have a lot of tokens and need to find more ways to minimize the tokenizer. What is essential? Well it’s quite hard to avoid the <code>atoi()</code> if we want to actually have integer literals. What else do we need? How about nothing.</p>\n<h3>Big Insight #2</h3>\n<p>Big Insight #2 is that <code>atoi()</code> behaves as a (bad) hash function on ordinary text. It consumes characters and updates a 16-bit integer. Hashes are perhaps the holy-grail of computer-science.\nWith a good hash, we can just side-step all the hard problems by trading them for an even harder problem (hash collisions), and then we just ignore that harder problem. Brilliant. (sticks fingers in ears) 🤪</p>\n<p>So we have this:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Token Type</th>\n<th>Meaning of atoi()</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Integer Literal</td>\n<td>uint16 number</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Keyword</td>\n<td>token ”enum” value</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Identifier</td>\n<td>hash value into a 64K array</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Implementing Barely C</h2>\n<p>The first implementation of Barely C fit in 468 bytes. It was a simple recursive-descent parser over the <code>atoi</code> tokens. There was no symbol table of any kind. Variables simply access a 64K segment using the hash value. Codegen is emitted somewhat similar to <a href=\"otcc_deobfuscated.html\">OTCC</a>, using <code>ax</code> as the result register and shuffling values to the stack and then to <code>cx</code> for binary operators.</p>\n<h2>Minimizing with Byte-Threaded Code</h2>\n<p>In an attempt to steal every good idea Forth ever had, I then dreamed up what I will call “byte-threaded-code”. Since a sector is 512 bytes, if we simply align address on a 2-byte boundary, we can do addressing with a single byte! We can have a series of “gadgets” and do forth-style threading:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-bash\">bits 16\n  cpu 386\n\n  jmp 0x07c0:entry\n\nentry:\n  push cs\n  pop  ds\n\n  lea si,operations\nnext:\n  xor ax,ax\n  lodsb\n  add ax,ax\n  push next\n  jmp ax\n\nputch:\n  mov ah,0x01\n  mov al,bl\n  mov dx,0\n  int 0x14\n  ret\n\n  align 2\nhang:\n  jmp hang\n\n  align 2\nprint_F:\n  mov bx,'F'\n  jmp putch\n\n  align 2\nprint_G:\n  mov bx,'G'\n  jmp putch\n\noperations:\n  db 17  ; print_F\n  db 20  ; print_G\n  db 17  ; print_F\n  db 17  ; print_F\n  db 20  ; print_G\n  db 17  ; print_F\n  db 17  ; print_F\n  db 17  ; print_F\n  db 20  ; print_G\n  db 16  ; hang\n</code></pre>\n<p>Annoyingly, <code>nasm</code> won’t let you do something like <code>db print_F/2</code> so I had to write a custom little assembler to do it.</p>\n<p>Alas, this idea didn’t work out. In 512 bytes, the overhead of this Forth-style computation model doesn’t pay for itself. There are a lot of little overheads: 2 byte alignment, extra <code>ret</code> instructions, calling other “threads”, the <code>next</code> function, etc. The byte-threaded version of Barely C ended up at the same size as the straight-forward version</p>\n<p>However, the idea is fun and I decided to document it anyways in the event that someone else finds utility.</p>\n<h2>Minimizing the Straight-Forward version</h2>\n<p>Instead, I returned to the straight-forward version and minimized it as much as possible. From 468 bytes ⇒ 303 bytes (165 bytes saving): 510 - 303 ⇒ 207 spare bytes to use for new features!</p>\n<p>Some tricks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reorganize code to allow “fall-through” instead of <code>jmp</code> or <code>call</code></li>\n<li>Use tail-calls via <code>jmp</code> wherever possible</li>\n<li>Perform call-fusion (e.g. <code>call tok_next2</code> instead of <code>call tok_next; call tok_next</code>)</li>\n<li>Utilize <code>stosw</code> and <code>lodsw</code> extensively</li>\n<li>Eliminate machine code tables for cheaper inline <code>stosw</code> versions</li>\n<li>Prefer <code>cmp ax,imm</code> over <code>cmp bx,imm</code></li>\n<li>Keep jump offsets within 8-bits to encode more efficiently</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Look Ma, A Real C!</h2>\n<p>As it turns out, a lot can be accomplished in 200 bytes if you already have a tokenizer, parser, and code-generator in 300 bytes. With these 200 bytes, <em>Barely C</em> became a proper C:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arbitrarily nested <code>if</code> statement block with an arbitrary expression condition</li>\n<li>Arbitrarily nested <code>while</code> statement block with an arbitrary expression condition</li>\n<li>Lots of operators: <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>^</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code></li>\n<li>Grouping expressions: <code>( expression )</code></li>\n<li>Function definitions and recursive function calls (using <code>func()</code> as a hash value into a symbol table at segment 0x3000)</li>\n<li>A special <code>asm</code> statement for inline machine-code</li>\n<li>Single-line <code>//</code> comments</li>\n<li>Multi-line <code>/*</code> comments</li>\n<li>A trick to do “space-injection” before semicolons to make code look more normal</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The biggest enabler here is the <code>binary_oper_tbl</code> which allows for a very cheap way to add lots of operations. Each operator is simply a <code>&lt;16-bit token-value&gt; &lt;16-bit-machine-code&gt;</code> pair, costing just 4 bytes.The above 14 operators cost just 56 bytes plus a little overhead to scan the table.</p>\n<h2>Grammar</h2>\n<p>Here's the full grammer specification:</p>\n<pre><code>program     = (var_decl | func_decl)+\nvar_decl    = &quot;int&quot; identifier &quot;;&quot;\nfunc_decl   = &quot;void&quot; func_name &quot;{&quot; statement* &quot;}&quot;\nfunc_name   = &lt;identifier that ends in &quot;()&quot; with no space&gt;\nstatement   = &quot;if(&quot; expr &quot;){&quot; statement* &quot;}&quot;\n            | &quot;while(&quot; expr &quot;){&quot; statement* &quot;}&quot;\n            | &quot;asm&quot; integer &quot;;&quot;\n            | func_name &quot;;&quot;\n            | assign_expr &quot;;&quot;\nassign_expr = deref? identifier &quot;=&quot; expr\nderef       = &quot;*(int*)&quot;\nexpr        = unary (op unary)?\nunary       = deref identifier\n            | &quot;&amp;&quot; identifier\n            | &quot;(&quot; expr &quot;)&quot;\n            | indentifier\n            | integer\nop          = &quot;+&quot; | &quot;-&quot; | &quot;&amp;&quot; | &quot;|&quot; | &quot;^&quot; | &quot;&lt;&lt;&quot; | &quot;&gt;&gt;&quot;\n            | &quot;==&quot; | &quot;!=&quot; | &quot;&lt;&quot; | &quot;&gt;&quot; | &quot;&lt;=&quot; | &quot;&gt;=&quot;\n</code></pre>\n<p>In addition, both <code>// comment</code> and <code>/* multi-line comment */</code> styles are supported.</p>\n<p>(NOTE: This grammar is 704 bytes in ascii, 38% larger than it's implementation!)</p>\n<h2>Inline Machine-Code</h2>\n<p>A programming language without I/O is useless. And, as the C language is defined in an I/O agnostic way, we need some way out. Thus, an <code>asm</code> extension is supported. This allows programs to generate raw x86-16 machine code literals inline. Using <code>asm</code>, programs can access any low-level detail of the machine. This is used extensively in the example code.</p>\n<h2>Error-Handling</h2>\n<p>What is “error-handling”? 🤣</p>\n<p>In traditional C style, we trust the programmer to write correct and well-formed programs. We are certain they are all minor gods and goddesses with the ability of perfection. Obviously, spending bytes on error-checking would be foolish. Surely all will agree that this is a very reasonable standard.</p>\n<p>For the less divine among us, a <code>lint</code> was also written (that doesn’t fit in a sector) to detect errors. The author certainly didn’t require this tool for development.</p>\n<h2>Runtime</h2>\n<p>If C compiler writers were a secret shadow organization like the Free Masons, Illuminati, Lizard Peoples, or Pizzagaters our inner-secret would be “C actually has a runtime”.</p>\n<p>SectorC has a runtime under <code>rt/</code> consisting of two files implemented in C itself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>rt/lib.c:</code> A collection of library routines, often coded in inline <code>asm</code></li>\n<li><code>rt/_start.c:</code> The actual entry-point <code>_start()</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The runtime code is concatenated with program source to construct the full source to compile and run.</p>\n<h2>Examples</h2>\n<p>A few examples are provided that leverage the unique hardware aspects of the x86-16 IBM PC:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>examples/hello.c:</code> Print a text greeting on the screen writing to memory at <code>0xB8000</code></li>\n<li><code>examples/sinwave.c:</code> Draw a moving sine wave animation with VGA Mode 0x13 using an appropriately bad approximation of <code>sin(x)</code></li>\n<li><code>examples/twinkle.c:</code> Play “Twinkle Twinkle Little Star” through the PC Speaker (Warning: LOUD)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It seems fitting to end an article with “takeaways” or “what did we learn”. So.. umm.. what did we learn? Honestly, I’m not sure. But in the interest of fun, here’s a Choice Your Own Adventure version of What Did We Learn:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>What Did We Learn</th>\n<th>Your Chosen Adventure</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Things that seem impossible often aren’t and we should Just Do It anyway</td>\n<td>Move to the South Pole with absolutely no gear on a Homesteading Mission</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Software is too bloated these days, we only need a few KBs</td>\n<td>Go check yourself into the technology hippie-commune of <a href=\"http://suckless.org\">suckless</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Error checking is overrated</td>\n<td>Take Elon up on his pitch to be a mars astronaut because Earth really doesn’t need more software that ignores errors.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Anything X can do, C can do better</td>\n<td>Something like this? <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WO23WBji_Z0&amp;t=10s\">link</a>.

class='post-body entry-content float-container' id='post-body-2098651784755638092'>\n<p>Back in 2005, when I first joined the SUNY Buffalo CSE department, the department secretary was a wonderful lady named Joann, who was over 60. She explained that my travel reimbursement process was simple: I'd just hand her the receipts after my trip, she'd fill out the necessary forms, submit them to the university, and within a month, the reimbursement check would magically appear in my department mailbox.</p><p>She handled this for every single faculty member, all while managing her regular secretarial duties. Honestly, despite the 30-day turnaround, it was the most seamless reimbursement experience I've ever had.</p><p>But over time the department grew, and Joann moved on. The university partnered with Concur, as corporations do, forcing us to file our own travel reimbursements through this system. Fine, I thought, more work for me, but it can't be too bad. But, the department also appointed a staff member to audit our Concur submissions.</p><p>This person's job wasn't to help us file reimbursements, but to audit the forms to find errors. Slowly but surely, it became routine for every single travel submission to be returned (sometimes multiple times) for minor format irregularities or rule violations. These were petty violations no human would care about if the goal were simply to get people reimbursed. The experience degraded from effortless to what could be perceived as adversarial.</p><p>This was a massive downgrade from the Joann era.</p><p><br /></p><h2 style=\"text-align: left;\">The Source of Friction</h2><p>This story (probably all too familiar to many) illustrates the danger of not setting the right intention regarding friction. If the goal isn't actively set to help and streamline the process (if the intention isn't \"how do we solve this?\"), the energy of the system inevitably shifts toward finding problems. Friction becomes the product.</p><p>This dynamic is not just true for organizations, it is also true for each of us.</p><p>We have to manage the stories we tell ourselves. These stories, whether we tell them knowingly or unknowingly, determine how we manage/conduct ourselves, which in turn determines our success. Just as organizations can start to manufacture friction, individuals can do the same internally. You can install an internal auditor in your own mind.</p><p>When intention shifts away from growth, things degrade. You stop asking how to move forward and start looking for violations. You nitpick and reject your own efforts due to small defects. You begin to find ways to grate against your own progress.</p><p>I wrote about this concept previously in my post \"<a href=\"https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2021/03/your-attitude-determines-your-success.html\">Your attitude determines your success</a>\". That post tends to get two very different reactions. It gets nitpicked to pieces by cynics (the auditors), and it gets a silent knowing nod from people in the know (the builders). Brooker recently wrote <a href=\"https://brooker.co.za/blog/2025/06/20/career.html\">career advice</a> along the same lines, reinforcing that high agency mindset. In a similar vein, I wrote about recently to <a href=\"https://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2025/12/optimize-for-momentum.html\">optimize for momentum.</a></p><p>&#8220;When there is a will, there is a way,&#8221; as the saying goes. Get the intention right and friction dissolves. Get it wrong and you may end up weaponizing process, tooling, and auditing against your own goals.</p>\n</div>\n<div class='post-bottom'>\n<div class='post-footer float-container'>\n<div

I start with the same&#160; disclaimer Lampson gave. These hints are not novel, not foolproof recipes, not laws of design, not precisely formulated, and not always appropriate. They are just hints.&#160; They are context dependent, and some of them may be controversial. That being said, I have seen these hints successfully applied in distributed systems design throughout my 25 years in the field, starting from the theory of distributed systems (98-01), immersing into the practice of wireless sensor networks (01-11), and working on cloud computing systems both in the academia and industry ever since.

Your default should be omission. Add a component only when you can explain why leaving it out would not work. Most models are about a slice of behavior, not the whole system in full glory: E.g., Leader election, repair, reconfiguration. Cut entire layers and components if they do not affect that slice. Abstraction is the art of knowing what to cut . Deleting should spark joy.&#160; Model specification, not implementation Write declaratively. State what must hold, not how it is achieved. If your spec mirrors control flow, loops, or helper functions, you are simulating code. Cut it out. Every variable must earn its keep. Extra variables multiply the state space (model checking time) and hide bugs. Ask yourself repeatedly: can I derive this instead of storing it? For example, you do not need to maintain a WholeSet  variable if you can define it as a state function of existing variables: WholeSet =...\n</div>\n<a class='snippet-fade r-snippet-fade hidden' href='http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2025/12/tla-modeling-tips.html'></a>\n</div>\n<div class='jump-link flat-button ripple'>\n<a href='http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2025/12/tla-modeling-tips.html' title='TLA+ modeling tips'>\nRead more &gt;&gt;\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</article>\n<article class='post' role='article'>\n<h3 class='post-title'><a href='http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2021/02/foundational-distributed-systems-papers.html'> Foundational distributed systems papers</a></h3>\n<div class='post-header'>\n<div class='post-header-line-1'>\n<span class='byline post-timestamp'>\n-\n<meta content='http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2021/02/foundational-distributed-systems-papers.html'/>\n<a class='timestamp-link' href='http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2021/02/foundational-distributed-systems-papers.html' rel='bookmark' title='permanent link'>\n<time class='published' datetime='2021-02-27T13:26:00-05:00' title='2021-02-27T13:26:00-05:00'>\nFebruary 27, 2021\n</time>\n</a>\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class='item-content float-container'>\n<div class='popular-posts-snippet snippet-container r-snippet-container'>\n<div class='snippet-item r-snippetized'>\nI talked about the importance of reading foundational papers  last week.

A project feels daunting when you face it as a blank page. It feels easier when you built some momentum with some next steps. So, momentum makes the difference between blocked and flowing. Think of a stalled truck on a desert road. You can&#39;t lift it with superhuman strength. But by rocking it with small periodic forces at the right rhythm (matching its natural frequency) you can get it rolling. Each tiny push adds to the previous one because the timing aligns with the system&#39;s response. The truck starts to move, and then the engine catches. Projects behave the same way. A big project has its own rhythm. If you revisit it daily, even briefly, your pushes line up. Your brain stays warm. Context stays loaded . Ideas from yesterday are still alive today. Each session amplifies the last because you are operating in phase with your own momentum.

The goalposts for AGI shifted; we stopped asking AI to merely &quot;talk&quot; and demanded that it &quot;act&quot;.

They read less like computer science and more like &#8230; self-help advice . The secret to agentic intelligence seems to lie in three very human habits: writing things down, talking to yourself, and pretending to be someone else. They are almost too simple. The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Writing One of the most profound pieces of advice  I ever read as a PhD student came from Prof. Manuel Blum, a Turing Award winner.

I recommend a principled, from the foundations-up, studying of distributed systems, which will take a good three months in the first pass, and many more months to build competence after that.   If you are practical and coding oriented you may not like my advice much. You may object saying, &quot;Shouldn&#39;t I learn distributed systems with coding and hands on? Why can I not get started by deploying a Hadoop cluster, or studying the Raft code.&quot; I think that is the wrong way to go about learning distributed systems, because seeing similar code and programming language constructs will make you think this is familiar territory, and will give you a false sense of security.

Get ready to quench your thirst from my fount of wisdom. No man, think for yourself, only get what works for you. It is called foundations, not theory Foundations of computer science (or rather any field of study) are the most important topics you can learn. These lay down the frame of thinking/perspective for that area of study. Yet, I am saddened to hear these called as &quot;theory&quot;, and labeled as &quot;unpractical&quot;. This couldn&#39;t be farther from the truth. Take a look at how I recommend studying distributed systems . Don&#39;t you dare call this &quot;theory&quot; and &quot;unpractical&quot;. This lays the bedrock that you build your practice on. Don&#39;t skimp on the foundations. Don&#39;t build your home on quicksand.

TL;DR: While network bandwidth per dollar improved by one order of magnitude (10x), CPU and DRAM gains (again in performance per dollar terms) have been much more modest. Most surprisingly, NVMe storage performance in the cloud has stagnated since 2016. Check out the NVMe SSD discussion below for data on this anomaly. CPU Trends Multi-core parallelism has skyrocketed in the cloud. Maximum core counts have increased by an order of magnitude over the last decade. The largest AWS instance u7in now boasts 448 cores. However, simply adding cores hasn&#39;t translated linearly into value. To measure real evolution, the authors normalized benchmarks (SPECint, TPC-H, TPC-C) by instance cost. SPECint benchmarking shows that cost-performance improved roughly 3x over ten years. A huge chunk of that gain comes from AWS G...\n</div>\n<a class='snippet-fade r-snippet-fade hidden' href='http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2026/01/cloudspecs-cloud-hardware-evolution.html'></a>\n</div>\n<div class='jump-link flat-button ripple'>\n<a href='http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2026/01/cloudspecs-cloud-hardware-evolution.html' title='Cloudspecs: Cloud Hardware Evolution Through the Looking Glass'>\nRead more &gt;&gt;\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</article>\n<article class='post' role='article'>\n<h3 class='post-title'><a href='http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2025/02/my-time-at-mit.html'> My Time at MIT </a></h3>\n<div class='post-header'>\n<div class='post-header-line-1'>\n<span class='byline post-timestamp'>\n-\n<meta content='http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2025/02/my-time-at-mit.html'/>\n<a class='timestamp-link' href='http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2025/02/my-time-at-mit.html' rel='bookmark' title='permanent link'>\n<time class='published' datetime='2025-02-16T22:47:00-05:00' title='2025-02-16T22:47:00-05:00'>\nFebruary 16, 2025\n</time>\n</a>\n</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class='item-content float-container'>\n<div class='item-thumbnail'>\n<a href='http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2025/02/my-time-at-mit.html'>\n<img alt='Image' sizes='72px' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjoZE-0eOmKIQ1Z9jrcV_5e1KOny0ho0QAt-qP_asRcIKYan9UcCJDNyyHoxv7np-wV2bqoz2GkNTOqV9n4ImSywp2XunMcOq1euWAe1MN91FMDQedy4RyHbUx4zbdDnYXatF5lQFnbj0EXEpRC8xggO3cuC5VgnpB8fApgnKE50tItZGMzjcsolWTw1kk/w400-h296/stata.jpg' srcset='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjoZE-0eOmKIQ1Z9jrcV_5e1KOny0ho0QAt-qP_asRcIKYan9UcCJDNyyHoxv7np-wV2bqoz2GkNTOqV9n4ImSywp2XunMcOq1euWAe1MN91FMDQedy4RyHbUx4zbdDnYXatF5lQFnbj0EXEpRC8xggO3cuC5VgnpB8fApgnKE50tItZGMzjcsolWTw1kk/w72-h72-p-k-no-nu/stata.jpg 72w, https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjoZE-0eOmKIQ1Z9jrcV_5e1KOny0ho0QAt-qP_asRcIKYan9UcCJDNyyHoxv7np-wV2bqoz2GkNTOqV9n4ImSywp2XunMcOq1euWAe1MN91FMDQedy4RyHbUx4zbdDnYXatF5lQFnbj0EXEpRC8xggO3cuC5VgnpB8fApgnKE50tItZGMzjcsolWTw1kk/w144-h144-p-k-no-nu/stata.jpg 144w'/>\n</a>\n</div>\n<div class='popular-posts-snippet snippet-container r-snippet-container'>\n<div class='snippet-item r-snippetized'>\nTwenty years ago, in 2004-2005, I spent a year at MIT&#8217;s Computer Science department as a postdoc working with Professor Nancy Lynch. It was an extraordinary experience. Life at MIT felt like paradise, and leaving felt like being cast out. MIT Culture MIT&#8217;s Stata Center was the best CS building in the world at the time. Designed by Frank Gehry, it was a striking abstract architecture masterpiece ( although like all abstractions it was a bit leaky ). Furniture from Herman Miller complemented this design. I remember seeing price tags of $400 on simple yellow chairs. The building buzzed with activity. &#160;Every two weeks, postdocs were invited to the faculty lunch on Thursdays, and alternating weeks we had group lunches. Free food seemed to materialize somewhere in the building almost daily, and the food trucks outside were also good. MIT thrived on constant research discussions, collaborations, and talks.
